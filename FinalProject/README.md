We used Project 2 as a base project
1) **Difficulties**

   **- Collision: No matter what we did, the VR pawn went through walls. Eventually we ended up using the FirstPersonShooter instead**

   **- We originally wanted the maze to have gates that open and close based on triggers which would change the maze. That would have been out 3D sound component**

   **- We also wanted some traps and to have lives and 2D UI to display the**

2) **End Result**

     **- Instead the shooter goes to the middle of the maze as the goal**

     **- There is a monster in the middle, which we wanted to be animated but could not find a way to do that easily. However we have him make sounds (3D sound)**

     **- To escape you solve a riddle which is the 2D UI Component**
